# Predictive-Model-for-Student-Performance
This project builds a machine learning model to predict student performance based on academic data such as marks, attendance, or other relevant features. The goal is to help educators identify students who may need additional support and improve overall academic outcomes.
# Student Performance Prediction

## 📌 Overview
This project predicts student performance based on dataset attributes like attendance, CGPA, and other metrics.  
It uses a Machine Learning model in Python and provides a user-friendly frontend for interaction.

## 🗂 Project Structure
- **.venv/** – Python virtual environment
- **data/** – Dataset files for training and testing
- **frontend/** – HTML, CSS, JS files for the UI
- **app.py** – Backend application (Flask API)
- **requirements.txt** – List of required Python packages
- **README.md** – Project documentation
